### Part 1 - Deadlock

#### 1. Deadlock example:

MOVE = (north->(south->MOVE|north->STOP)).

Output from system, we see a potential deadlock:

Composition:
DEFAULT = MOVE
State Space:
 3 = 2 ** 2

  potential DEADLOCK

#### 2. In our example the second MOVE state does not have an exit.

### Part 2 - Livelock
#### 1.
A livelock is similar to a deadlock, except that the states of the processes involved in the livelock constantly change with regard to one another, none progressing. Livelock is a special case of resource starvation; the general definition only states that a specific process is not progressing.

### Part 3 - Dining philosophers
#### 1. 3 philosophers with 3 phorks.

PHIL = (sitdown->right.get->left.get
          ->eat->left.put->right.put
          ->arise->PHIL).

FORK = (get -> put -> FORK).

||DINERS(N=3)= 
   forall [i:0..N-1] 
   (phil[i]:PHIL 
   ||{phil[i].left,phil[((i-1)+N)%N].right}::FORK).

menu RUN = {phil[0..2].{sitdown,eat}}

Output from the system:

Composition:
DINERS = phil.0:PHIL || {phil.0.left,phil.2.right}::FORK || phil.1:PHIL || {phil.1.left,phil.0.right}::FORK || phil.2:PHIL || {phil.2.left,phil.1.right}::FORK
State Space:
 7 * 2 * 7 * 2 * 7 * 2 = 2 ** 12

#### 2.
Change the N variable in diners. It could handle a couple of hundreds, although it started compiling very slowly.

#### 3. Deadlock free dining philosophers:

PHIL(I=0) = (when (I%2==0)
                 sitdown->left.get->right.get
                   ->eat->left.put->right.put->arise->PHIL
            |when (I%2==1)
                 sitdown->right.get->left.get
                   ->eat->left.put->right.put->arise->PHIL
            ).

FORK = (get -> put -> FORK).

||DINERS(N=5)= 
   forall [i:0..N-1] 
   (phil[i]:PHIL(i) 
   ||{phil[i].left,phil[((i-1)+N)%N].right}::FORK).

From the output we see no potential deadlocks:

Composition:
DINERS = phil.0:PHIL(0) || {phil.0.left,phil.4.right}::FORK || phil.1:PHIL(1) || {phil.1.left,phil.0.right}::FORK || phil.2:PHIL(2) || {phil.2.left,phil.1.right}::FORK || phil.3:PHIL(3) || {phil.3.left,phil.2.right}::FORK || phil.4:PHIL(4) || {phil.4.left,phil.3.right}::FORK
State Space:
 7 * 2 * 7 * 2 * 7 * 2 * 7 * 2 * 7 * 2 = 2 ** 20

#### 4.
Deadlocks can be avoided by introducing an assymetry. For example you could make the "even" philosophers pick up their left forks first while the "odd" philosophers pick up their right forks first. In addition this would be a fair solution.
