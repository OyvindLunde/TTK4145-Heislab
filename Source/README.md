### Elevator FSM

The finite state machine has 3 states and 3 events:

| States        | Events            |
|:-------------:|:-----------------:|
| IDLE          | NewOrder          |
| EXECUTE       | MotorDirection    |
| RESET         | FloorReached      |
|               | OrderTimeout      |



**IDLE:** The elevator is standing still at a floor and is awaiting new orders.

**EXECUTE:** The elevator is currently executing an order.

**RESET:** The elevator has timed out whle executing an order, and needs to be reset.

**NewOrder:** The elevator has received a new order, and will check its validity and availability before executing the order.

**MotorDirection:** The elevator has gotten a new MotorDirection, and will start to run in the given direction.
