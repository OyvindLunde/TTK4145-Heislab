# Elevator project

## Project description

**Software for controlling `n` elevators working in parallel across `m` floors.**


- Video av kjørende system med display 

## Usage
**Prerequisites for running the program**
- Go
- Linux/Ubuntu
- Elevator simulator  - https://github.com/TTK4145/Simulator-v2
- Package for Display module - https://github.com/golang/exp/tree/master/shiny/driver

**Adding and running elevators**  
For each elevator do the following steps.

1. Open a terminal and run SimElevatorServer, specify a 5 digit port  
   `./SimElevatorServer --port xxxxx`
2. Open another terminal and run main.go  
   `go run main.go`
3. Enter an ID for the elevator and set the adress equal to the port specified in SimElevatorServer  
   `Enter Id: x`  
   `Enter Address: xxxxx`  
   
**NOTE:** Each elevator has to have a unique ID and port/address.  

Hotkeys for controlling the elevator can be found at https://github.com/TTK4145/Simulator-v2

### Elevator FSM

The finite state machine has 3 states and 3 events:

| States        | Events            |
|:-------------:|:-----------------:|
| IDLE          | NewOrder          |
| EXECUTE       | MotorDirection    |
| RESET         | FloorReached      |
|               | OrderTimeout      |



**IDLE:** The elevator is standing still at a floor and is awaiting new orders.

**EXECUTE:** The elevator is currently executing an order.

**RESET:** The elevator has timed out whle executing an order, and needs to be reset.

**NewOrder:** The elevator has received a new order, and will check its validity and availability before executing the order.

**MotorDirection:** The elevator has gotten a new MotorDirection, and will start to run in the given direction.

**FloorReached:** The elevator has reached a floor, and will check whether it should stop or not.

**OrderTimeout**
