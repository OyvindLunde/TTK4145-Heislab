## Project description

## Our system

### Main
Main() sets the id and addr parameters, initializes the system and creates all channels and starts all goroutines.

### Elevator FSM

The finite state machine executes the given order, and switches between the different states based on the generated events. It has 3 states and 3 events:

| States        | Events            |
|:-------------:|:-----------------:|
| IDLE          | NewOrder          |
| EXECUTE       | MotorDirection    |
| RESET         | FloorReached      |
|               | OrderTimeout      |



**IDLE:** The elevator is standing still at a floor and is awaiting new orders.

**EXECUTE:** The elevator is currently executing an order.

**RESET:** The elevator has timed out while executing an order, and needs to be reset.

**NewOrder:** The elevator has received a new order, and will check its validity and availability before executing the order.

**MotorDirection:** The elevator has gotten a new MotorDirection, and will start to run in the given direction.

**FloorReached:** The elevator has reached a floor, and will check whether it should stop or not.

**OrderTimeout:** If the elevator had taken to long time to finish and order, typically because of motor power loss, an OrderTimeout event is generated to tell the system to reset itself.

### OrderHandler
The OrderHandler module controls all the logic for the elevator, such as deciding if the elevator should take an order, which direction it should go in, and whether or not it should stop when reaching a floor. It also handles incoming orders from button presses. 

### Communication
Communication transmits to and receives data from the network, and handles the received information.

### Network
The most basic functions for transmitting and receiving data. Mainly delivered code, with some changes.

### LogManagement
Logmanagement stores all information about both the local elevator and other elevators on the network, such as their state, orders and current floor.

### Ticker
A basic timer module.

### ElevController
Module containing basic functions for controlling the elevator.

### ElevIO
The most low-level functionality for interacting with the hardware.

### Display
Due to the coronavirus, and one group members light autism, we programmed and implemented a display that showed all connected elevators, as well as their state, orders and other relevant information. This made it much easier to see what was going on when running the system and debug it when errors occured.
See the README file in the Source/Display folder for a more thourough explanation of this module.
