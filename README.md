# Elevator project

## Project description
**Create software for controlling `n` elevators working in parallel across `m` floors.**  
We were free to implement our solution however we wanted, but there were some system requirements which had to be fulfilled:

  - **No orders are lost**  
     Once the light on a hall call button is turned on, an elevator should arrive at that floor.
  - **Multiple elevators should be more efficient than one**  
     Similarly for a cab call, but only the elevator at that specific workspace should take the order.
  - **An Inidividual elevator should behave sensibly and efficiently**  
     This means handling network packet loss, losing network connection entirely, software that crashes, and losing power - both to the elevator motor and the machine that controls the elevator.
  - **The lights should function as expected**  
     If the elevator is disconnected from the network, it should still serve all the currently active orders (ie. whatever lights are showing)

## Usage
**Prerequisites for running the program**
- Go
- Linux/Ubuntu
- Elevator simulator  - https://github.com/TTK4145/Simulator-v2
- Package for Display module - https://github.com/golang/exp/tree/master/shiny/driver

**Adding and running elevators**  
For each elevator do the following steps.

1. Open a terminal and run SimElevatorServer, specify a 5 digit port  
   `./SimElevatorServer --port xxxxx`
2. Open another terminal and run main.go  
   `go run main.go`
3. Enter an ID for the elevator and set the adress equal to the port specified in SimElevatorServer  
   `Enter Id: x`  
   `Enter Address: xxxxx`  
   
**NOTE:** Each elevator has to have a unique ID and port/address.  

Hotkeys for controlling the elevator can be found at https://github.com/TTK4145/Simulator-v2

### Elevator FSM

The finite state machine has 3 states with 4 events:

| States        | Events            |
|:-------------:|:-----------------:|
| IDLE          | NewOrder          |
| EXECUTE       | MotorDirection    |
| RESET         | FloorReached      |
|               | OrderTimeout      |



**IDLE:** The elevator is standing still at a floor and is awaiting new orders.

**EXECUTE:** The elevator is currently executing an order.

**RESET:** The elevator has timed out whle executing an order, and needs to be reset.

**NewOrder:** The elevator has received a new order, and will check its validity and availability before executing the order.

**MotorDirection:** The elevator has gotten a new MotorDirection, and will start to run in the given direction.

**FloorReached:** The elevator has reached a floor, and will check whether it should stop or not.

**OrderTimeout**
